# Classroom Chaos
This is a silly little game I made to become familiar with GameMaker. My goal was to become familiar with basic mechanics and solutions to common problems. This will aid me in teaching high school students to make their own games with GameMaker.

# DISCLAIMER
### **I do not in any way condone violence against anyone or anything, in any way. This game was made purely as a joke and should not be seen as an endorsement or glorification of violence**

## Use
Download the `zip` file, extract it to your location of choice, and run the `exe` file.

## Controls
Use W, A, S, D to move up, left, down, and right, respectively. You can discipline students when standing next or behind them by clicking on the student. 

If you're at a distance, grab a chair by walking up to it and clicking on it. Then, you can throw it in any direction by pointing to it with your cursor and clicking again. The chair ignores desks and computers.

## Development
To continue development, download a copy of the repo, and open it as a project in GameMaker. You must download the software first, here: https://gamemaker.io/en/download
